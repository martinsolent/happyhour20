## Irrational by Design 
Contrary to popular belief, we are all irrational and make decisions based on emotion, not logic. Humans are constantly exploring methodologies and possibilities to achieve happiness. As designers, we have the power and responsibility to help people reach their goals. Matt’s talk aims to show the importance of understanding the human brain and how it works to take your design work to the next level.
