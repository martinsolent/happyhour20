Laura is a Senior UX Consultant at [Experience UX] (https://www.experienceux.co.uk/). She has spent the last 13 years in the digital industry, first as a Web Developer and eventually moving into User Experience Design, fuelled by a growing curiosity about the people she was creating products and services for. Her passions are contextual research, systems thinking, and behavioural psychology. When sheâ€™s not immersed in experience design and spending time with her family, she can also be found reading, taming her garden, and playing the piano out of tune.
