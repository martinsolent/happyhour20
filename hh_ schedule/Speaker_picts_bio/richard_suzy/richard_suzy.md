## Screw it. Let's do it!
How to move forward fast and get things done.

The focus on my talk will be how I got into the digital industry and the story of Brightful so far. It will include personal insights on what it takes to set up an agency, the courage it takes to move forward faster, dealing with the unexpected, adopting a growth mindset, building positive networks and embracing the exciting opportunities of the gig economy.
